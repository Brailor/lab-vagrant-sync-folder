# Lab Vagrant Sync folder
The goal of this lab to make yourself confident with using `Vagrant` and VM's in general by configuring `Vagrant` to provision a Linux box that has sync folders set up with your host machine, and thus enables "remote" development on the target OS. (Linux in this case)

## Goals

- create `Vagrantfile` with the relevant configuration to provision a Linux VM
- setup Sync Folders on the target machine
- connect to the target machine's synced folder with VS Code remote development plugin
